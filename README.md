# Applied Machine Learning Approach For Sonic Log Prediction

The goal of the study below is to use machine learning algorathems in order to train different set of wireline logs to predict DT the sonic log.

## Libraries
pandas
matplotlib
numpy 
scipy 
 seaborn

## Motivation
The realm of petrophysics is still underdevelopment , studying statsitcal predictive methods of different logs is of importance . in this case, predicting sonic log can help in cost savings specially in hetrogenious reservoirs . also it can be used to enhance Geo-Models a 1% difference can mean millions of barrels of oil.

1. Can we Predict DT from different wireline logs? 
2. Can we use predicted DT to predict porosity ?
3. Can Predicted DT be used in Seismic corrections?
## Results
My post in LinkedIn summarizes the main findings of the expirement.
